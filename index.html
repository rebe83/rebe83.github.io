    <h1> 
      Bio
    </h1>
    Theo is currently a CS undergraduate at UIUC. He graduated from Orion High School in 2017,<br> 
    a class of 86 students. He had no CS experience until coming to college.<br>
    His experiences in high school has led to a passion for music.<br>
    Career-wise, Theo plans on graduating and then returning to grad school at UIUC to get a<br> 
    PHD in computer science. Then, he would like to use his degree to research human-computer<br>
    interreaction, and find new ways computers can help people, especially those in impoverished<br>
    countries where there is little technological access. He decided to study computer science<br>
    since is apparent that computers have taken over the world, so what better way to help<br> 
    as many people as possible as with computers?
